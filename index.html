  <h1>Hi, I'm R Nanavati ðŸ‘‹</h1>
 

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>With 5+ years of work experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), I have contributed to innovative projects across retail, healthcare, education, and information services. My work has focused on developing scalable search and recommendation systems that address real-world challenges and enhance user experiences. I have been an integral part of teams driving these impactful solutions, collaborating across functions to ensure technical excellence and business alignment. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve developed a deep appreciation for understanding the broader context of business goals and the strategic impact of technology. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's in Data Science, I bring a strong foundation in AI, machine learning, and data-driven problem-solving. As I continue to explore the transformative potential of AI, I am also keen to grow into roles that involve a bigger-picture perspective, bridging the gap between technical innovation and strategic decision-making.Letâ€™s connect and discuss how we can collaborate to build smarter, innovative solutions and drive meaningful impact!</p>
